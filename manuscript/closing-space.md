In March 2013, Russian prosecutors launched inspections of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) across the country. Hundreds of groups were targeted, from human rights and environmental organizations to health-care associations. Russian suspicion of NGOs is not a new phenomenon and a law passed in 2012 forced organizations that received foreign funding and deemed to engage in "political activities" to register as "foreign agents" - a derogatory term meant to stigmatize NGOs. Since then, many other countries in the region have followed suit. For instance, in June 2017, Hungary cracked down on thousands of NGOs for "endangering sovereignty and national security of Hungary." 

These developments are not just limited to authoritarian countries, but are also present in robust democratic states such as India. In 2010, India amended its Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA), targeting all non-profits receiving money from foreign sources and prohibiting those whose activities were `political' in nature. Since 2014, the Indian government canceled the licenses of over 9,000 NGOs, including prominent international groups such as the Ford Foundation and Greenpeace (Express 2015)

Despite the greater diversity of actors in transnational advocacy, and numerous structural changes that have provided increased political power to Southern actors in the transnational arena, there has been increasing state crackdown on NGOs over the last two decades. What strategies are states using to repress NGOs? What are the causes behind this crackdown, and what consequences can it have for NGOs, the donor community, and citizens across the globe? This chapter addresses these questions below. 

# Strategies to Restrict Space for Civil Society Groups

States across the globe are resorting to a myriad of violent and non-violent strategies to restrict the space available to civil society activists. 

Violent crackdown entails actions such as arrests, disappearance, extra-judicial killings of civil society activists, and attacks on NGO offices. Front Line Defenders, a Dublin-based group that aims to protect human rights defenders at risk, documented the killings 128 of 156 human rights defenders in 2015 and 130 in 2014. They further pointed out that arrests of human rights activists continues to be the most frequently employed method of overt crackdown against such organizations.

Besides the use of violent strategies, the examples of Russia, Hungary, and India demonstrated above show the use of non-violent strategies, primarily, legislations, to control, restrict, and eliminate NGO activity. According to data from the International Center for Not-for-Profit Law, between 2004-10, more than 50 countries enacted measures restricting civil society [@Rutzen:2015, 3]. More broadly, between 1990-2013, 79 developing countries introduced severe barriers to entry for NGOs, and 69 countries imposed some form of funding restriction on NGOs. Such restrictions included limiting foreign funding or requiring that all money towards NGOs be channeled through government banks [@chaudhry2016].

The sharp increase in this restrictions is worrisome for two main reasons. First, robust civic associations are often seen as a crucial component for healthy democracies [@Putnam1994]. These organizations enable citizens to voice their opinions through elections, advocacy, and other forms of political and civic participation. By clamping down on such organizations, states are narrowing the form of democratic institutions and processes available to their citizens.

Second, international donors channel a large amount of aid to developing countries via NGOs. In states with poor governance records, donors prefer non-governmental mechanisms for transferring aid [@Dietrich2013], as this avoids problems such as corruption and incompetence. In 2012, USAID spent approximately $4.3 billion on assistance to civil society around the world, with the World Bank spending approximately $11 million on the same in 2009 [@tierney2011]. A crackdown on foreign-funded NGOs can consequently lead to a decline in services offered to citizens in developing countries.

# Causes

There are numerous reasons why states may perceive NGOs as costly or threatening to their interests. NGOs can impose costs on states through four main mechanisms: (1) challenging a state's economic interests, (2) challenging a state's security interests, (3) aiding domestic mobilization, and (4) influencing electoral politics.

Increased resources to NGOs followed the expansion of democracy promotion in the days after the fall of the Soviet Union (Carothers year?). This event led to increased support for civil society and NGO operations by Western countries, especially in states transitioning from authoritarian rule. Although this strategy was viewed as relatively benign during the 1990s, Carothers (year) argues that this perception changed with the Western-coordinated overthrow of the Milosevic regime and the success of the Color Revolutions in Georgia, Ukraine and Kyrgyzstan. Incumbents feared that given the resources, civil society groups could organize a successful electoral opposition or even a revolutionary movement. State elites, consequently, began to be suspicious of the democracy-promotion agenda and the NGOs implementing these goals. 

However, in addition to violence against NGOs and activists, states also began engage in administrative crackdown (Chaudhry 2016). This entails enacting legal restrictions to create barriers to entry, funding, and advocacy for NGOs. Barriers to entry entail difficulties in setting up operations in a particular country, which includes burdensome registration by increasing the complexity and severity of registration requirements, and exercising discretion in approving registration and denying permits.
Barriers to funding include blanket restrictions on foreign funding for NGOs or for NGOs working in a particular sector. Some countries also choose to block funding based on its origin, restricting foreign NGOs from having a maximum number of employees hat can be foreign, and travel restrictions on employees of foreign NGOs. Finally, barriers to advocacy for NGOs includes the imposition of restrictions on NGOs for engaging in political activities, especially for those NGOs which receive foreign funds. The term 'political activities' is often left undefined under such laws, making it easy for the government to crack down on any NGO deemed to be costly. 

While violent crackdown is useful against NGOs posing immediate threats, such as those engaging in mobilization, states cannot use violence against all NGOs. This is because violence can reduce the state’s legitimacy, violate human rights treaties and preferential trading agreements, and further mobilize the population against the regime. Therefore, in the long term, states prefer restrictive NGO legislation or administrative crackdown. Such a strategy overcomes the negative consequences associated with violence and is less likely to invite condemnation from the international community. 

Recent research analyzing the causes behind crackdown on foreign-funding to NGOs in particular, argues that states often see these foreign funds as providing resources to political opponents (Carothers and Brechenmacher 2014; Dupuy, Ron, and Prakash 2016). They argue that when governments perceive their political survival as being threatened, they are willing to let go of the benefits accrued from foreign-funded NGOs operating within their territories. Governments are willing to incur the reputational cost of enacting restrictive NGO laws. Dupuy, Ron, and Prakash (2016) find that regimes that have recently experienced competitive elections are particularly likely to crack down on foreign aid to locally operating NGOs.

# Consequences

Restricting the space and resources available to civil society organizations can have numerous consequences for NGOs themselves, for donors, and for the citizens of these countries. 

## For NGOs
For NGOs - how they are changing their operations - ANDREW
Changing patterns in NGO advocacy strategies

Restrictions on foreign funding in particular are worrisome for three reasons. First, citizens in many developing countries are too poor to support a local NGO community. Without the provision of
foreign aid, it may be impossible for this sector to sustain itself. Second, even for countries that have substantial wealth, a culture of charitable-giving to NGOs may not exist. For instance, over 90% of human rights NGO activities in Israel are funded from Europe and America (Dupuy, Ron and Prakash 2015). Therefore, sweeping laws that block such funds for local NGOs have a large adverse impact on the functioning and existence of domestic NGOs in a state. Third, even when domestic philanthropists seek to provide money to NGOs, states can often coerce them to withhold their funding by threatening
to not approve their business permits or withdrawing their tax exemptions.

local NGOs may need to invest in resources and manpower to mobilize local resources. Previous scholarly and practitioner work has emphasized that many NGOs have increasingly hired employees and devoted more resources to win foreign grants and contracts [@Bush:2015, 46-49]. Aside from debating the potential adverse effects of such competition and professionalization on the nature of work undertaken by NGOs, it may the case that such practices may not neatly carry over in attempting to procure funding domestically.

## For Donors
State crackdown on NGOs - whether violent or non-violent - can have numerous consequences for international donors as well. Both state-led and private donors channel a large amount of aid to developing countries via NGOs. Using original data on civil society restrictions across 148 countries from 1981–2013, we assess the impact of legal restrictions on NGOs on total flows of foreign aid, how aid is distributed, and which issues are funded. We find that additional anti-NGO legal barriers—in particular, barriers to advocacy—decrease the amount of foreign channeled to the restrictive country. Besides reducing the amount of aid, donors also redirect funds within restrictive countries, decreasing funds for politically sensitive causes in favor of tamer issues that are more compatible with the governments of those countries. These findings bolster Bush's claims [-@Bush:2015] that donors tame their programming when confronting dictators. 

Finally, donors—USAID in particular—channel more aid to domestic over foreign NGOs in order to assuage target country concerns about external interference in domestic politics. Since previous research has documented that governments often perceive foreign NGOs as external interference in domestic politics, increasing aid to domestic NGOs is likely to assuage these concerns. However, this finding is based on limited data by USAID over only a decade. This finding also reflects USAID’s perception that increasing assistance to respected local NGOs can help the regulatory environment from worsening, as these local NGOs can help both diplomatic and lobbying efforts, as well as spark domestic outrage against restrictive legislation.

While our research has looked at the effects of barriers to entry, funding, and advocacy on the amounts and targets of aid, as well as the purpose of such aid,  @DupuyPrakash look at the effects of the adoption of restrictive NGO finance laws in particular. They find that such laws associated with a 32% decline in bilateral aid inflows in subsequent years. On the other hand, multilateral donors and overseas diaspora do not reduce aid in response to such restrictive funding laws.

## For Citizens/Public/Whatever
Finally, state crackdown on NGOs may also effect citizens' perception of these organizations, their participation in them, and charitable-giving towards them. Public vilification of civil society organizations and the use of negative public rhetoric by government officials towards these organizations has been frequently employed. For instance, in Russia, many NGOs are publicly condemned as 'foreign agents', which has Cold War-era connotations of being a spy or a traitor. However, such vilification occurs even in consolidated democracies - In Canada, environmental NGOs have been labeled as 'radicals', 'revolutionaries', and 'adversaries' by government officials (Potter 2012). 

Such attacks on NGOs, as well as negative coverage in the media may encourage public suspicion of foreign NGOs and citizens may assume that such NGOs are inherently untrustworthy.  Barkan (2012) surveying 1,473 recipients of democracy assistance, found that the recipients recognized the risk of receiving democracy assistance: 37% of those receiving such aid felt that the greatest risk was being labeled an "agent" or "stooge" of outside countries, with 48% of these respondents living countries classified as "Not Free" by Freedom House.

Negative rhetoric towards these groups may also decrease charitable donations by citizens towards these organizations. Ron and Crow (2015) carried out surveys of nationally representative samples in Colombia and Mexico and in parts of Mexico and India to explore citizens' levels of trust and participation in local human rights organizations (HROs) in these countries. They found that levels of participation and donations to HROs remain pretty low, regardless of public trust in these organizations. Only 1% of the respondents in Morocco claimed to have ever participated in the activities in HROs, with the highest percentage being in Mumbai at a little over 7%. Even fewer people donate to HROs, with only 1% of respondents in Morocco saying that they had ever donated to HROs, to a little over 4 percent of the respondents in Mumbai who had done the same. However, it is hard to assess whether low levels of participation and donation to these human rights organizations is a trend that was pre-existing, or made worse by some of the laws passed against NGOs in the countries that were surveyed. 

This decrease in charitable-giving  is especially dangerous for domestic NGOs at a time when so many governments are cracking down on foreign funding for NGOs. Thus, these groups may be unlikely to survive simply on membership-based fundraising models along the lines of their well-established Western counterparts.

# Conclusion
There have been numerous changes in transnational advocacy over the last few decades, which have created new opportunities such as greater diversity of actors and increased political power to Southern actors in the international arena. Along with an expansion in opportunities at the international level, we are however also witnessing a government backlash against civil society organizations at the national level. 

Existing theories on transnational advocacy networks view NGOs as costly to vulnerable or weak authoritarian leaders due to their ability to engage in naming and shaming. Authoritarian leaders therefore limit challenges to their rule by implementing policies that ensure demobilization of civil society and placing punitive measures on associational groups. However, these theories do not fully capture the nature of state responses to such advocacy networks. Over 120 states, including many democracies, are cracking down on advocacy networks due to their ability to influence electoral politics, aid mobilization, and challenges states' economic and security interests. 

To prevent this onslaught of attacks against CSOs, many domestic civil society organizations have been able to ally together and stop a state's repressive actions. For instance, In Kenya, in December 2013, NGOs successfully pressured the Parliament to avoid adopting a newly proposed law that capped foreign funding contributions to 15%. The bill was defeated by a close margin of 83-73 votes and one of the reasons attributed to its defeat was the, "organizationally dense coalition of international and local activists," that lobbied the Ministers of Parliament in Kenya. Since then, this coalition has withstood numerous other attempts by the Kenyan government to impose restrictions on civil society.
Thus, there is reason to be optimistic, particularly in democratic countries, where lobbying by NGO apex bodies can convince legislatures to vote against repressive legislations.

REVISE/ADD TO ENDING. Given that states can limit efficacy of NGOs, it has important implications for NGOs as a tool of foreign aid and democracy promotion, and more broadly, for state-civil society relations.
